# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

To be decided

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

So my project is going to be similar to jackbox party games. Just a trivia game with a good amount of different categories.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
In my project I am going to have 6-8 different topics for the player to choose. These topics are chosen most popular topics either from school or just news. The game will show a picture, ask a question, and proceed to the next question. The questions are chosen based on the category you pick. Python will be used for this game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Each cetegory is successful choosing its specified questions with a picture.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Random questions instead of an order of the questions relating different pictures.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Random questions instead of an order of the questions relating to specific pictures.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The only thing needed to be learned or researched is the pictures showing up. And how to access the pictures and when they should appear. Everything is almost done already but I am going to try and make changes for the best or better outcome.
